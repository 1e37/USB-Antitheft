# USB-Antitheft
Enhance your security and protect sensitive data by transitioning your device to a BFU (Before First Unlock) state. This proactive measure helps prevent physical theft and unauthorized access to your information.

When your device is in the BFU state, it remains locked and inaccessible, ensuring that even if it is physically stolen, the data stored on it cannot be easily dumped. This is particularly important for devices that contain sensitive or confidential information, as it adds an additional layer of protection against data breaches.
